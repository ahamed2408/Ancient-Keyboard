# Ancient-Keyboard
We all could have come across many keyboards, with numpad/no numpad etc. This is one of a simple kind of keyboard used in the initial days. There are only 10 keys in the keyboard and it supports only English alphabets. This keyboard works in three different modes: 1. Text to Number 2. Number to Text 3. Game Mode. The way to use the keyboard is simple, 1. AMMA = 1.5.5.1 2. CAT = 111.1.77 3. MIRROR = 5.333.666.666.555.666 4. SuDoKu = 7.#.777.#.2.#.555.#.44.#.777 The number of repetition in the keys decide the actual words and the special key (#) just flips between uppercase and lowercase or vice versa. You have to come up with a similar keyboard to perform the same. Your code should work in two modes, 1. As described above, to have sequence generated from the words 2. To take input as the same sequence and return the corresponding decoded words. No where in your code, you should store the char to number mapping except the special keys (space and #) Game mode: The game mode is enabled using ### and turned off the same way. Simple games that stands only four directions are played. The only keys that gets enabled are 2, 4, 6, 8 and #. Until the game mode exits out, no other key functions and doesnâ€™t print any value. No repetitions are allowed in Game mode. Example: 246 should print Up, Left and Right, where as, 2244 or 6688 should end up in error.
